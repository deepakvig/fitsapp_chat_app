    # Roles inherit from less important roles, so:
    # - :admin has permissions defined in :member, :guest and himself
    # - :member has permissions from :guest and himself
    # - :guest has only its own permissions since it's the first role.
    #
    # The most important role should be at the top.
    # In this case an administrator.
    #
    role :admin, proc { |user| user.is_admin? } do
      can [:read, :create, :update, :destroy], Message
    end

    # More privileged role, applies to registered users.
    #
    # role :member, proc { |user| user.registered? } do
    #   can :create, Post
    #   can :create, Comment
    #   can [:update, :destroy], Post do |post, user|
    #     post.author == user
    #   end
    # end
    
    role :member, proc { |user| !user.is_admin? } do
      can :create, Message
      can :read, Message
          #   can [:update, :destroy], Post do |post, user|
          #     post.author == user
          #   end
    end
    
    # The base role with no additional conditions.
    # Applies to every user.
    #
    # role :guest do
    #  can :read, Post
    #  can :read, Comment
